Steps to create and display an OSD data:
----------------------------------------
	1. Create an image(.jpg or .png) of required resolution(say 20x20)
	which has to be displayed over video.

	2. Convert the image to required YUV format using following command-
		$ ffmpeg -i filename.jpg -s 20x20 -pix_fmt <format> filename.yuv
			where <format> will be according to the format of video data.
			for ex:	 yuyv422 is for YUY2 video format
			Here, 20x20	is the resolution of input image

	3. copy filename.yuv to database/ directory.

	4. Update all the Macro variables for the particular OSD Window, where
	this OSD data has to be displayed. For example if OSD WINDOW two is 
	selected for the image, following changes to be done in inc/osd_thread.h
		OSD_WINDOW_TWO_X 100
		OSD_WINDOW_TWO_Y 200
		OSD_WINDOW_TWO_W 20
		OSD_WINDOW_TWO_H 20
	These above changes will display an image of resolution 20x20 at location
	(100,200) over the video.

	5. The name of the OSD data file to be displayed on Window 2 should be
	"win_2.yuyv".

Important notes:
----------------
	1. OSD data should always be in same format as that of video data.
	2. All OSD data should be present inside database/ directory.
	3. ffmpeg package can be intalled to an Ubuntu machine with following-
		$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
